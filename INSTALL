Installation instructions
-------------------------

To build, where “make” is the command for GNU make, run

	$ make linguistica

If you have trouble, run

	$ make V=1 linguistica

to see what commands make is trying to run and read the comments at
the beginning of the Makefile on how to change them.  Please also
contact us in this case, so we can fix the problem.

On Mac OS X, running “make linguistica.app” builds an application bundle
with a nice icon.

After the build, the executable can be run from any directory.

Dependencies
------------

  - The pkg-config [1] command is used to determine the paths to
    libraries.

    If you do not want to use pkg-config, you can tell “make” the
    relevant paths on the command line.  See the comments near the
    beginning of Makefile for more on this.

  - Qt 4 [2] is used for Unicode support and to provide a GUI.
    Version 4.4 or later is recommended, since earlier versions
    have broken pkg-config files.

  - If found at build time, the GraphVizContext library [3] is used
    to display the discovered model of morphology as a finite-state
    machine.

    To disable this feature, pass “NO_GRAPHVIZ=YesPlease” on the
    “make” command line.
